# Push to remote
git push origin main
```

## Files to be committed:
- `migrations/README.md` - Brief description of the migrations directory
- `migrations/migrate_database.py` - The migration script
- `migrations/DATABASE_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` - Simple guide explaining the migration process

## Optional: Clean up duplicate files
If you have these files in the root directory, you can remove them:
```bash
rm -f DATABASE_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md complete_db_migration.sql migrate_database.py
```

The migration tools are now organized in a dedicated `/migrations/` directory to keep them separate from the main code.
