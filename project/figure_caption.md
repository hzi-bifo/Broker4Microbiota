**Figure 1.** Broker4Microbiota (B4M) platform interface overview demonstrating the integrated workflow for MIxS-compliant metadata collection and processing. 

**(A)** Five-step workflow guides users from project creation through validation, with visual progress indicators showing completion status. The embedded metadata collection ensures standards compliance at the point of sequencing order submission. 

**(B)** Interactive MIxS checklist selection interface displays environment-specific packages parsed directly from NCBI XML files. The Human Gut checklist (82 fields) is shown selected with customization options for field selection. 

**(C)** Spreadsheet interface powered by Handsontable provides familiar Excel-like functionality for bulk data entry with real-time validation, copy-paste support, and undo/redo capabilities. 

**(D)** Administrative dashboard enables sequencing facilities to track order status, trigger nf-core bioinformatics pipelines (e.g., nf-core/mag for metagenome assembly), and perform batch ENA submissions through an intuitive web interface.
